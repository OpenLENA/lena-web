This is the home of the OpenLENA Web Server.
A portable installation file including centos7,8 and amazon linux is provied based on Apache httpd.
OpenLENA Web server also provides everything required for creating and configuring Web Server so easily.

All feature following will be working with CLI.

The feature of OpenLENA Web server Open Edition : 

+ Installation : Create, Delete and Clone server. Don't need to type in much things when create server, just required server name and service port.
  Clone server is so useful when you wanna save the status of the server right away.
 
+ Execution : Start, Stop server. You can check the server status just with a command "ps". Just in case, service request is under abnomal status and you need to
              restart the server forcely. Use the command "force restart server_id". 

+ Package : Portable installation files are provided for each OS (Centos7, Centos8 ...). Installation is complete simply by extracting the installation file. We are in charge of difficult tasks such as Compile performed in the OS.
